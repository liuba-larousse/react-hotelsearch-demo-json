<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<p align="center">
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/liubalarousse/image/upload/v1623167167/for%20portfolio/hotelsearch-react-demo_nuoyne.png" width="75%" alt="landing page">
</p>

This project was build with intention of practicing and learning basic React skills. I used Material UI for styling of repeating elements like typography fonts, cards, buttons. I used SCSS for layout and customized style of unique elements of the page.

Project is inspired by my love for traveling and AirBnb landing page design. Project consists of a hotel search landing page, which takes a list of hotels from API (or in this case JSON that I have created specifically for this project with structure based on real API JSON structure) and displays the infomation about each hotel on the landing page. Hotels can be sorted by fiew parameters like price, rating and reviews based on the data , that is stored in JSON object related to each hotel. Once particular hotel is clicked, the dynamic page is created for it with the display of more detailed information about the hotel.
